Kukuclara Collection💕
======================

This app is made with React.js/Redux to look up, filter and sort the overall series of Kukuclara dolls.
> As a Kukuclara doll collector, I need a website where I can easily see the data on the collection. I hope that Kukuclara fans like me can get help for their collection but also have fun learning about the collection with my app❤
